Flink on AWS
===================

A streaming benchmark on Flink.

This work is finished by Xu Zhenqiang(jkadbear@gmail.com) at Advanced Digital Sciences Center (ADSC). 

The topology is implemented in `flink-example` project. Under `script` folder, there lies some dirty shell scripts for operating cloud machines.

`analysis.html` shows the result generated from `LOGS`. Because the log files are so large, we only provide one example `LOGS/20161212/5000-600/600.log` in this git repo.
